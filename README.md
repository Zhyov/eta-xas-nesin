# e'ta xas ne'sin
e'ta xas is a language I made inspired in toki pona.<br>
It has 46 letters each represented by 1 to 2 characters of the Latin script.<br>
This repository will have one of two websites being those the official guide and dictionary of e'ta xas to learn this language (If you are crazy enough).<br>
This repository is for the guide website.
